# Web projects to practice

#### Personal challenges to create web projects in html, css and vanilla js

At the beginning of the year I decided that I should practice my web development skills more.

That's why I decided to create several projects with html, css and javascript. Starting from the simplest projects to the most complex ones.


### The practical exercises are obtained from the following pages:
